#What is AI? 
* Making computers that think?
* The automation of activities we associate with human thinking, like decision making, learning ... ?
* The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people ?
* The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models ?
* **Anything in Computing Science that we don't yet know how to do properly ? (!)**

# Meet HAL 9000

---
class: top
## 2001: A Space Odyssey
  * Classic science fiction movie from **1969**;
  * Part of the story centers around an intelligent computer called HAL
.red[HAL] - .red[**H**]euristically programmed .red[**AL**]gorithmic computer  
  * HAL is the “brains” of an intelligent spaceship
  * in the movie, HAL can
    + speak easily with the crew
    + see and understand the emotions of the crew
    + navigate the ship automatically
    + diagnose on-board problems
    + make life-and-death decisions
    + display emotions
    
**In 1969 this was science fiction: is it still science fiction?**

???
* HAL is the imidiate letters after IBM;

# Can we build hardware as complex as the brain?
## How complicated is our brain?
* a neuron, or nerve cell, is the basic information processing unit
* estimated to be on the order of $10^{12}$ neurons in a human brain
* many more synapses ( $10^{14}$ ) connecting these neurons
* cycle time: $10^{-3}$ seconds (1 millisecond)

# Can we build hardware as complex as the brain?
## How complex can we make computers?
* ~ 730k transistors per CPU 
* supercomputer: millions of CPUs, $10^7$ GB of RAM 
* cycle times: order of $10^{-9}$ seconds

# Can we build hardware as complex as the brain?
## Conclusion
* .red[YES]: we can have computers with as many basic processing elements as our brain;
* far fewer interconnections (wires or synapses) than the brain
* much faster updates than the brain
* **but building hardware is very different from making a computer behave like a brain!**
